# Project Theory: Movie Rating Insights
## 🎯 Objective:
The main goal of this mini-project is to analyze and visualize a small movie dataset to gain insights into movie ratings, genres, and audience preferences. It helps beginners understand how to handle datasets, perform basic statistical operations, and visualize data using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## 📝 Dataset Details:
A sample dataset is manually created which consists of the following features:

- Movie: The name of the movie.

- Genre: The category to which the movie belongs (Action, Drama, Sci-Fi, etc.).

- Rating: IMDb-like rating on a scale of 1 to 10.

- Votes: Number of votes received by the movie.

## 🔍 Steps Involved:
1. Importing Libraries:

- pandas for data handling.

- matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.

2. Dataset Creation:

- A dictionary is used to define movie details.

- Converted into a Pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation.

3. Data Analysis:

- Calculate the average movie rating.

- Identify the top 3 highest-rated movies.

- Compute genre-wise average ratings.

- Find the most popular movie based on vote count.

4. Visualizations:

- Bar Plot to show individual movie ratings.

- Genre-wise average rating plot.

- Votes vs Rating Scatter Plot to observe correlation.
